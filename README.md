<h1 align="center">todo <span style="color: #61DBFB;">react</span></h1>

This is one of those projects that every developer ends up doing with their first contact with a new language.
<p>The <b>todo <span style="color: #61DBFB;">react</span></b> is a very simple application for creating and organizing tasks.</p>
This was my first ReactJS project, and I made him in two versions, one with Redux and one without.

<!-- ![](frontend/assets/todo-react.png) -->

### :rocket: Demo
<p>The deploy was made on <b>Netlify</b> and you can access in here https://todo-react-cvs.netlify.app/</p>

<p><b>PS:</b> The first request (when creating the first task) will take a while to return an answer because the API will be in "hibernate" mode.
The "hibernate" "mode happens because the API doesn't get a lot of constant access.</p>
