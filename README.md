### :rocket: Demo
<p>The deploy was made on <b>Netlify</b> and you can access in here https://todo-react-cvs.netlify.app/</p>

<p><b>PS:</b> The first request (registration or login) will take a while to return an answer because the API will be in "hibernate" mode.
The "hibernate" "mode happens because the API doesn't get a lot of constant access.</p>
